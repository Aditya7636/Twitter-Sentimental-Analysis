Twitter Sentimental Analysis of the Russia Ukraine Conflict
Since February of this year, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has gotten worse, and many countries have introduced economic sanctions on Russia to support Ukraine. There are millions of tweets about the Ukraine and Russia war where people often share their opinions on the situation and who they are supporting. The Project aims to understand the sentiments of people concerning the Ukraine and Russian War by collecting and analyzing 2.4 million tweets for the March period across the globe and telling a story with an interactive dashboard highlighting the insights of the dataset.
The Tools and Services used in the Project are:
• Python: To extract tweets, store, aggregate, build dataframes, perform analysis and make datasets ready for visualization.
• Twitter API: Fetching real-time tweets from Twitter.
• Kaggle: Downloading large Twitter datasets.
• Tableau: Building Tableau Dashboards for Visualization.

Project Pipeline: In the Juypter Notebook I carried out the following steps for the project:
1) Tweets Mining
2) Data Cleaning and Tweets Processing
3) Data Exploration
4) Location Geocoding
5) Sentiment Analysis
6) Tableau Dashboard7
